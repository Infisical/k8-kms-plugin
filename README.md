# KMS Plugin for Infisical

Enables [encryption at rest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/#providers) of your Kubernetes data in etcd using Infisical. With this plugin, you can use a key in Infisical for etcd encryption.

ðŸ’¡ **NOTE**: Currently, this KMS plugin only supports Kubernetes KMS v2.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Your Kubernetes cluster must use etcd v3 or later.
- Your Kubernetes cluster must be at least version 1.28.
- You will need to have an existing KMS key on Infisical. To create one, refer to the documentation [here](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/kms#key-management-service-kms).

### Authentication
There are multiple ways to authenticate the KMS plugin with Infisical:
- [GCP Auth](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/identities/gcp-auth): recommended if you're running the cluster on GCP
- [Azure Auth](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/identities/azure-auth): recommended if you're running the cluster on Azure
- [AWS Auth](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/identities/aws-auth): recommended if you're running the cluster on AWS
- [Universal Auth](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/identities/universal-auth): recommended if you're running the cluster on-premise.

## Installation
The recommended cluster installation method of the KMS plugin is via [static pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/static-pod). Thus, you will have to configure the following steps for each of the control plane nodes of your cluster.
